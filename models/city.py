        created_at (datetime): The datetime when the City instance was created.
        updated_at (datetime): The datetime when the City instance
                was last updated.
        state_id (str): The foreign key linking the City to a State.
        name (str): The name of the City.
        places (relationship): One-to-many relationship with the Place class,
